### Project Euler
is a [website](https://projecteuler.net/) dedicated to a series of [computational
problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems are intended for adults and
students interested in mathematics and computer programming.

### This Repository
contains solutions to some of the problems solved with the [Rust programing language](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).
I am solving these recreationally in my spare time. It is unlikely that I will have the time or the knowledge to be able
to solve all of them.
